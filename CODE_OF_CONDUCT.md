### Introduction

The Helix community is dedicated to providing a welcoming, inclusive, and constructive environment for everyone. Our goal is to foster a space where individuals of all backgrounds can collaborate, learn, and grow. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participant behavior and the consequences of unacceptable behavior.

### Our Standards

- **Be Respectful and Inclusive:** Treat everyone with respect. Refrain from using discriminatory language or making jokes that may alienate or offend others based on their gender, sexuality, religion, ethnicity, race, age, or ability. Remember that we are a diverse community, and differences in perspective should be valued.

- **Be Kind and Considerate:** Be thoughtful in your interactions with others. Disagreement is natural, but itâ€™s important to engage respectfully and constructively. Avoid personal attacks or insults. Instead, focus on the issue at hand and propose solutions.

- **Be Collaborative:** Collaboration is key to the success of our community. Share knowledge, support each other, and contribute to the common goal of improving Helix. Recognize the work of others, give constructive feedback, and be open to feedback about your own work.

- **Be Mindful of Language:** Avoid using overtly sexual or violent language. Do not post, share, or link to inappropriate content, including but not limited to, sexually explicit material, violent imagery, or hate speech. Ensure that your communication is appropriate for a professional and diverse audience.

- **Respect Privacy:** Do not share others' private information without their explicit permission. Respect confidentiality and consider the implications of sharing personal details in public forums.

- **Give Credit:** Respect intellectual property by acknowledging the contributions of others. Do not plagiarize or claim others' work as your own. Ensure that you provide proper attribution in your code, documentation, and communications.

- **Be Concise:** Constructive criticism and suggestions are welcome, but high-traffic forums do not generally have the bandwidth for extensive discourse. Be concise and to the point in your communications. Consider writing a blog post if you feel that you have enough to say on a particular subject.

- **For Researchers:** We welcome the participation of researchers of all kinds in the Helix community. However, please remember that open source development is a social process and that the participants on the other side of any interaction are (obviously) humans. If you are conducting research on the community or its processes, you are expected to abide by the highest standards of ethics and professional practice.

### Enforcement

Community members are expected to adhere to these standards. Unacceptable behavior may be addressed by the Helix Conduct Team in the following ways:

#### Enforcement Actions

1. **Correction:** A private, written message providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

2. **Warning:** A formal warning about the behavior, including a temporary restriction on interaction with the community for a specified period of time. Any further violations may lead to more severe consequences.

3. **Temporary Ban:** Temporary removal from community spaces for a specified period of time for serious or repeated violations. External channels, such as social media, should not be used to bypass these restrictions during the temporary ban.

4. **Permanent Ban:** Permanent removal from the community for severe or persistent inappropriate behavior. This measure is used as a last resort when other enforcement actions have failed to resolve the issue.

### Reporting Issues

If you encounter or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it to the Helix Conduct Team at [conduct@neorain.co](mailto:conduct@neorain.co). Your report will be handled confidentially. 

#### What to Include in a Report

Please include the following information in your report, if possible:

- Your contact information (optional but helpful).
- Names of the individuals involved, including any witnesses.
- A description of the incident, including when and where it occurred.
- Any relevant context or additional information that might be helpful in understanding the situation.
- Links to any public records, such as community discussions or chat logs.
- Whether you believe the incident is ongoing.

#### What Happens After Reporting

1. **Acknowledgement:** You will receive a reply from the Helix Conduct Team acknowledging receipt of your report within 1-10 business day.

2. **Review:** The Conduct Team will review the incident as soon as possible to determine what happened and who was involved. They will assess whether this event constitutes a Code of Conduct violation and whether it poses any ongoing threat to physical safety.

3. **Action:** If a violation has occurred, the Conduct Team will decide on appropriate enforcement actions based on the severity of the incident. This may include one or more of the enforcement actions outlined above.

4. **Communication:** The Conduct Team will communicate their decision to the individuals involved and any actions taken. They will also provide regular updates to the original reporter until the situation is resolved.

#### Appeals

If you believe that the enforcement action taken is unfair or inappropriate, you may appeal the decision. Appeals should be directed to the Helix Project Leads at [appeals@helix-lang.org](mailto:appeals@helix-lang.org). Please provide any relevant information or context to support your appeal.

#### Special Cases

If a complaint is raised against a member of the Conduct Team or Helix Project Leads, they will be excluded from conduct discussions and decisions, including appeals. Such complaints may lead to a member's responsibilities being revoked to ensure an unbiased review process.
